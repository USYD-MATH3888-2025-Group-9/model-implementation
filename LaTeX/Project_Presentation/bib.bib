title = {Inhibitor-Induced Wavetrains and Spiral Waves in an Extended FitzHugh–Nagumo Model of Nerve Cell Dynamics},
abstract = {It is well known that the FitzHugh–Nagumo model is one of the simplified forms of the four-variable Hodgkin–Huxley model that can reflect most of the significant phenomena of nerve cell action potential. However, this model cannot capture the irregular action potentials of sufficiently large periods in a one-parameter family of solutions. Motivated by this, we propose a modified FitzHugh–Nagumo reaction-diffusion system by changing its recovery kinetics. First, we investigate the parameter regime to know the existence of the wavetrains. Second, we conceive the occurrence of Eckhaus bifurcations of solutions that divide the solution region into two parts. The essential spectra at different grid points explore the occurrence of bifurcations of the waves. We find that the wavetrains of sufficiently large periods cross the stability boundary. This characteristic phenomenon is absent in the standard FitzHugh–Nagumo model. Finally, we observe a reasonable agreement between the direct PDE simulations and the solutions in the traveling wave ODEs. Furthermore, the model exhibits spiral wave for monotone and non-monotone cases that agrees with the waves observed in cellular activity.},

title = {Periodic solutions in an array of coupled FitzHugh–Nagumo cells},
abstract = {We analyse the dynamics of an array of N2 identical cells coupled in the shape of a torus. Each cell is a 2-dimensional ordinary differential equation of FitzHugh–Nagumo type and the total system is ZN×ZN-symmetric. The possible patterns of oscillation, compatible with the symmetry, are described. The types of patterns that effectively arise through Hopf bifurcation are shown to depend on the signs of the coupling constants, under conditions ensuring that the equations have only one equilibrium state.},
