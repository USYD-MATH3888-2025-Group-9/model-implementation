\section*{Presentation planning / writing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All members assembled in room 116 and finished writing their slides. 
    \item Difficulty was had with github diff management, but this was overcome with a bit of forced commits.
    \item The room was only able to be booked for 1 hour so a significant time pressure was felt. This was alleviated when Calvin offered us to walk 5 mins to his apartment to actually record the presentation 
    \item Presentation was recorded in Calvins apartment, on the topic of a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo system of equations.
    \begin{itemize}
		\item Each member of the group was recorded separately presenting their slides, to be edited later by Calvin
		\item Calvin agreed to upload the final product + slides as the assignment submission
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Meeting concluded with the attendees finishing recording the presentation and going their separate ways.
