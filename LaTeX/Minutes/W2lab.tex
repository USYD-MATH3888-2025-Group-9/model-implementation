		Albert is only second year, all others are third year. Good spread of MATH20/922, MATH20/921, MATH20/923, and various 3rd year units like non-linear odes, financial derivatives, metric spaces etc.
		Oscar and Kyle both have a second major in Physics, Oscar has minimal programming experience, Kyle has programmed in Swift. Calvin is CompSci major, and so is comfortable with programming. Tim has done Python and R previously, Albert has also done Python R, and has also done SAGE before.
