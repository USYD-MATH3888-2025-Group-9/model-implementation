\section{Project Direction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kyle noted that the time to select the project's direction was approaching, and put forth Chapter 10 of the textbook 
    as a potential direction.
    \item Albert suggested Chapter 4 as it may be easier from a mathematical and programming point of view.
    \item Kyle agreed with this, but added that an easier project may be less entertaining or interesting.
    \item Kyle and Albert then looked over the relevant textbook chapters, and concluded that it was best to make a final
    decision when the whole group was present.
\end{itemize}
The meeting concluded early as there was nothing further to discuss.\\
