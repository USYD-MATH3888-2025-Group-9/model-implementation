\section*{Deciding new project}

\rule{\linewidth}{1pt}



\begin{itemize}
    \item Kyle noted that Martin mentioned on Ed discussion that projects should involve \textbf{more than two ODEs}, so we are reconsidering our project design.
    
    \item Our previous project direction included a \textbf{PDE component}, which is out of scope for this pitch, so we must pivot.
    
    \item The most recent idea we explored also drifts into PDE territory, meaning we will need to conduct further research before committing.
    
    \item We discussed drafting an \textbf{email to Martin} to clarify the requirements --- specifically, to confirm:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Whether the \textbf{Hodgkin--Huxley model} is acceptable as a project basis.
        \item Whether having \textbf{more than two ODEs} is strictly required.
        \item Whether alternative models like the \textbf{Izhikevich model} would be considered valid.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Albert worked on the submodels and comparative analysis
    \item Kyle worked on the hodkin huxley and hindmarsh rose models
    \item Calvin worked on finding research papers
\end{itemize}
